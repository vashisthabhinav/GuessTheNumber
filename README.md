Created a class Game, which allows a user to play the "Guess the Number" game once. The game has the following methods:<br>
            1. Constructor to generate the random number<br>
            2. takeUserInput() to take a user input of number<br>
            3. isCorrectNumber() to detect whether the number entered by the user is true<br>
            4. getter and setter for noOfGuesses<br>
            5. Used properties such as noOfGuesses(int), etc to complete the task<br>
