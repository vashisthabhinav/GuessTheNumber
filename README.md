Created a class Game, which allows a user to play "Guess the Number"
            game once. Game has the following methods:
            1. Constructor to generate the random number
            2. takeUserInput() to take a user input of number
            3. isCorrectNumber() to detect whether the number entered by the user is true
            4. getter and setter for noOfGuesses
            5. Used properties such as noOfGuesses(int), etc to complete the task
